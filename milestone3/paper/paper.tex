\section{Introduction}
%Introduce the sections that follow. What is the problem this paper addresses? What is the core contribution of this paper, and why is that interesting? What method did you develop and implement? What is the research question or hypothesis this paper answers? How did you answer this question or validate your approach (empirically, analytically). You might want to give a brief (qualitative) sketch of the results. 
In this paper we continue the work related for creating an application for finding Handicap Parking Spots close to Event Venues in Amsterdam. In the previous paper, we improved on the ontology to comply with the Five Star model and linked it to other existing ontologies. In this paper, we continue the work by matching and aligning the ontology to other subject-related ontologies. 

In general, the problem of matching ontologies has been studied before by Semantic Web researchers. As Shvaiko et al. state, the problem of heterogeneity is still a challenge to be solved since ambiguity in meanings and interpretations prevent us from finding equivalences in same domain ontologies \cite{shvaiko2013ontology}. Ontology matching and alignment allow to merge, translate, and extend ontologies, finding correspondences both in entities, properties and instances. The Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative is an annual international competition that serves as an evaluation for state of the art alignment tools. 

With that in mind, in this paper we select relevant vocabularies from the pool of Amsterdam related ontologies in our class. After some comparison we selected Group 10 -an ontology for cultural activities-, Group 13 -an ontology about safety for tourists using statistical area information-, and Group 15 -an ontology for general activity finding.

In the following sections we first revise existing tools for matching and aligning ontologies. Then we select and apply tools for matching and aligning our ontologies to the aforementioned ones, experimenting with different comparators. We continue to evaluate such algorithms and discuss the results. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the findings of the alignment to different ontologies.

\section{Related Work}
%Give here an overview over related matching methods and how they related to your own solution. Cite papers that might have inspired your approach. Sometimes it makes sense to have this section immediately after the introduction.
In order to match our ontology to others, we did research about state of the art matching and alignment tools. \cite{adaptiveInformation_2014} is a comprehensive list of the top 50 tools, separating active from inactive tools. Additionally, we looked at some of the tools revised by Euzenat et Al \cite{euzenat2007ontology}. Furthermore, we looked at the participants from the most recent OAEI.

In the following we list the most relevant tools.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{OLA \cite{euzenat2004ontology}:} Developed in 2004, the OWL Lite Alignment (OLA) is a tool for automatic matching of ontologies that implements the OLA algorithm designed in collaboration by the DIRO, University of Montréal and INRIA Rhône Alpes. It participated in OEIA 2005 \cite{euzenat2005ola} and 2007 \cite{djoufak2007ola} and increased its own results from 0.80 to 0.89 in Precision, and 0.74 to 0.87 in Recall. At the time, it was one of the pioneers of ontology matching, yet no it is nowadays outdated.

	\item S-Match: Cannot read RDF files
	\item MapONTO: Old version of Protege
	\item WordNet:Similarity: http://maraca.d.umn.edu/cgi-bin/similarity/similarity.cgi
	\item AML
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methods, Algorithms and Implementation}
% Introduce your method, i.e. the overall approach taken and the general idea, the\bibliography{paper}
 algorithms in general, maybe in pseudo-code and give a quick overview over the technical implementations (not too much details).

% Maybe you want to separate this part into subsections for your two systems
\subsection{Ontology Matching}
- Decided to use one of the best candidates in the OAEI of 2014, AML (AgreementMakerLight) the best system (as measured in terms of F-measure) for lightweight ontologies. The reasons behind this choice was that AML exceeded our expectations with regard to run time results, comprehensive user interface and integrated evaluation mechanism. The procedure can be fully or semi automatic, with the user being presented to a fully customizable matching. We can choose between different metrics with respect to structure,content etc 
-examples with pictures, String Matcher, Word matcher, Property matcher, Cardinality matcher and background knowledge matcher.

\subsection{Data Linkage}

\section{Validation and Experiments}
% In a scientific paper you want to show that your choice of method and algorithms was the right choice. So, this could be a place where you make claims or ask concrete and explicit research questions (e.g. with respect to runtime and/or precision/recall.

\section{Results and Discussion}
% Give here details about the most important results of your experiments. Use tables and figures, but focus on the interesting and important results. Make sure you describe in the text what the reviewers should see, explain what the reader sees in the tables and point to the interesting findings. Be explicit about your research question and hypothesis, and discuss they might be true, or false. 


\section{Conclusion}
%Here you summarize the preceding sections, describe the lessons learnt and discuss future work.
