\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
The abstract should summarize the contents of the paper and should
contain at least 70 and at most 150 words. It should be written using the
\emph{abstract} environment.

\section{Introduction}
- Motivation: 
- Objective: Find events and their location
- compare reasoning is small designed dataset versus a large complex dataset. 

\section{Related Work}
- explain what Laundromat is

\section{Datasets}
We performed an exploratory analysis on the datasets we will be using. Hereby we describe the characteristics of both datasets. 

\subsection{Find a Slot dataset}
- 1874 instances of owl:Thing
- 479 instances of Event
- 681 instances of Location

\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b, caption=SPARQL query for counting resources per class, label=lst:sparql, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small,frame=bt]

SELECT ?class (COUNT(?resource) as ?count) WHERE {
?resource a ?class . 
} GROUP BY ?class ORDER BY DESC(?count)

\end{lstlisting}

Graph visualization using networkx and python plotting libraries.

\end{figure}

\subsection{LOD dataset}
- 25 Events with Location

\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b, caption=SPARQL query for getting Event with Location, label=lst:sparql, basicstyle=\ttfamily\small,frame=bt]

prefix event: <http://purl.org/NET/c4dm/event.owl#>

SELECT ?s ?p ?l
WHERE {
?s a event:Event .
{ 
bind(<http://vivoweb.org/ontology/core#hasGeographicLocation> as ?p) .
?s ?p ?lEn
}
UNION
{ 
bind(event:place as ?p) .
?s ?p ?lEn
}
?lEn rdfs:label ?l .
}

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Sub-graph extraction}
Event related graph

\subsection{Sub-graph analysis}
- new statistics

\section{Event finding}
- Query both datasets and report on instances gotten

\section{Conclusion}
Weight the differences between designing an ontology or cleaning existing ontologies.
